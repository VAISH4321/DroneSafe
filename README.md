# DroneSafe
DroneSafe is an AI-assisted simulation system designed to predict potential collisions between multiple drones in a 2D flight space. Using a constant-velocity prediction model, it forecasts drone positions over a user-defined time horizon and flags any risky intersections before they occur.
