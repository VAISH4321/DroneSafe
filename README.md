# DroneSafe: AI-Powered Drone Collision Predictor

DroneSafe is an AI-assisted simulation system designed to predict potential collisions between multiple drones in a 2D flight space. Using a constant-velocity prediction model, it forecasts drone positions over a user-defined time horizon and flags any risky intersections before they occur. The platform visualizes both current positions and predicted trajectories, helping operators make informed decisions to avoid accidents.

This project aligns with the **“Flight of the Future”** theme by enhancing UAV safety, supporting air traffic management, and improving efficiency for next-generation aerospace systems. It is built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, featuring an aerospace-themed interface for intuitive visualization.
