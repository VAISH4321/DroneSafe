DroneSafe â€“ AI-Powered Drone Collision Predictor

DroneSafe is an AI-assisted simulation system designed to predict and prevent collisions between multiple drones in a 2D flight environment. Using a constant-velocity prediction model, the platform forecasts drone positions over a user-defined time horizon and highlights potential risks in advance. It provides real-time visualization, enabling operators to make informed decisions and enhance UAV safety.

Features
